# carries the subdomain (app.example.com, srv123.hstgr.cloud with
# APP_SUBDOMAIN=srv123) is used verbatim rather than prefixed twice.
#
# Nothing about the host is baked into an image: the domain only ever reaches
# the stack through .env, which is why the same repo deploys to any number of
# servers and domains.
#
# Generates every secret, writes .env (0600), and brings the stack up. Safe to
# re-run: an existing .env is reused, never regenerated, so restarting the
# stack cannot silently orphan the database volume behind a new password.

=== Next steps ===
The stack is up, but it is not usable yet. In the app, as the admin:

  1. Log in at the URL above with the credentials shown earlier.
  2. Admin > Email / SMTP    — outgoing email. Until this is set, activation and
                               password-reset emails cannot be delivered at all.
  3. Admin > AI / LLM        — a free FenLLM trial account has been created for
                               you automatically and is selected by default; add
                               OpenAI/Anthropic/Google keys only if you want them.
  4. Admin > Plans           — switch the AI chatbot feature on for a plan. The
                               FenLLM model is already granted to every plan, so
                               there is no model access to set up unless you add
                               another provider's models.
  5. Admin > Settings        — currency and timezone.
  6. Admin > Customers       — add your first customer (invite by email or give a temporary password).
  7. Link Account            — pair a WhatsApp number by scanning a QR code.
  8. Chatbot                 — knowledge base, model, then switch the bot on.

Also worth knowing:
  - DNS for the host above must already point at this server, and a Traefik with
    a 'websecure' entrypoint and a 'letsencrypt' resolver must be running, or
    HTTPS will not work.
  - Every secret is in .env (mode 0600) next to docker-compose.yml. Do not rotate
    APP_SECRET_KEY or BACKEND_API_KEY on a live instance: everything already
    stored encrypted with them becomes unreadable.
